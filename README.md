# Overview
The Tunify Platform is a web application Iâ€™m developing to manage and organize music-related data, such as users, playlists, songs, artists, albums, and subscriptions. My goal is to create a seamless experience where users can interact with their music collections in a structured and intuitive way. This process involves integrating a relational database that reflects the entities and relationships defined in the project's Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

To achieve this, I've structured the project to include key steps such as creating database migration scripts, defining models for each table, and seeding initial data. By the end of this process, Tunify will have a fully functional database that accurately represents the core elements of the platform, providing a solid foundation for further development and feature integration.

# Application Setup

* Initial Configuration
* Created a new empty .NET Core Web Application.
* Installed essential NuGet packages, including Entity Framework Core and related tools, to facilitate database interactions.
* Connection String Configuration
* Added a connection string in appsettings.json to link the application to a local SQL Server instance, ensuring a secure and reliable connection to the TunifyDB database.
* Defining Models & Setting Up the Database
* Models: Created models for each entity based on the ERD, starting with the User model and expanding to include Subscription, Playlist, Song, Artist, and Album.
* DbContext: Configured TunifyDbContext to manage these models, ensuring that Entity Framework Core could handle database operations efficiently.
* Migrations: Generated and applied migration scripts to create the necessary tables in the database, starting with the Users table and expanding to include other entities.
* Seeding Initial Data
* Implemented seed data to populate the User, Song, and Playlist tables with initial entries. This step ensures that the database has meaningful data to work with during development and testing.

# Final Steps

* Verified that the database structure and seed data are correctly set up, ensuring that the Tunify Platform is ready for further development.
